# Loan-Status-Python-Project
Automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 

There are two data files test_raw.csv and train_raw.csv. The train_raw.csv is used to train the model and the test_raw.csv file is used to test the model. I do not have the correct values for the Loan_Status once it is predicted by the model to compare.

The data files have the foloowing columns:
